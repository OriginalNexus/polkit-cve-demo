Local Privilege Escalation in polkit's pkexec (CVE-2021-4034)
---

## Requirements

You need to have `docker` and `make` installed.

## Demo

First, create and run the vulnerable docker container using the following 
command:

```shell
make run
```

Once inside the container, notice that you are logged in as the non-privileged
user `attacker`. To execute the exploit, run `./exploit`:

```
attacker@victim:/work$ ./exploit
Executing exploit...
root@victim:/work#
```

Congratulation! You are now root.
